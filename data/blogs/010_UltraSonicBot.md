### Introduction
This was my first project in electrical and automation and it was also the first time I realized what I should pursue later in life. My professor asked me to do something with STM34F407. Then I decided to build A remote-controlled 4-wheel robot and challenge myself with controlling Ultrasonic sensors. Because it was my first project, it didn't look nice, but worked very smoothly.
